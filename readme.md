# Through the Lens 

## Description

Through the Lens is a platform for photographers to connect, showcase their work, share insights, and build relationships with others who love photography. It offers a dedicated space for photographers to display portfolios, receive feedback, and engage in discussions about techniques and trends.

The project aims to fill a market gap by uniting photographers worldwide in a community focused solely on photography. Unlike generic social media, Through the Lens provides specialised forums, galleries, and critique tools tailored to photographers' needs.

Built using the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js—Through the Lens delivers a dynamic, responsive, and scalable web application. This technology ensures smooth image uploads, real-time updates, and an interactive user experience, fostering a thriving community for photography enthusiasts.
