Aperture:** Use a larger aperture (a smaller f-number) to allow more light into your camera. This will help you capture more detail in low light.\\n\\n**2. ISO:** Increase your ISO setting to make your camera's sensor more sensitive to light. Be cautious, as higher ISO settings can introduce noise to your images.\\n\\n**3. Image Stabilization:** Use a tripod or image stabilization features to avoid camera shake and achieve sharper images.\\n\\nExperimenting with these settings can greatly improve your low light photography skills. Happy shooting!\\n\\n**Author:** Liam Beckett",
